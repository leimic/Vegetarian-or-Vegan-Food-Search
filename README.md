## About this App
The purpose of this app is to help people find restaurants that serve vegetarian or vegan meals.
It was made with Yelp Fusion API (https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/).

Often times, when going to a restaurant that doesn't advertise itself as having vegetarian or vegan options, the only appropriate foods to order would be side dishes or a salad, which aren't really meals. This app uses the Yelp API to find restaurants that would serve actual meals for people with vegetarian or vegan diets.
